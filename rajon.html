          <p>Bangladesh is a land of mystery and intrigue. The country is centuries old and while it has seen many visitors over the years, it is only now starting to experience a commercial tourism boom. In many respects,<strong> Bangladesh is a land of opportunity and adventure. All you need do is step out and discover its many mysteries for yourself.</strong><br>
            
There are so many things to be enjoyed here. Perhaps one of the most popular activities is that of sunning yourself on the exquisite white sandy beaches of<strong> Cox’s Bazaar and Teknaaf.</strong> Both beaches are situated on the eastern coast of the Bay of Bengal and are relatively unspoilt by tourists <em>making them a great place to spend vacation time.</em> Another attraction is the many archaeological sites in the country. They are interesting from a cultural and architectural point of view and can be fascinating to tour. <strong>Bangladesh’s other attraction is a bit more lively – <em>the Royal Bengal Tigers</em> which have become somewhat of a trademark for the country.</strong> These stunning big cats are somewhat protected in the country and are stunning to behold!<br>

<strong>Bangladesh is also home to the longest sea beach</strong>, the largest tea gardens and some amazing exotic animal life. To top it off, the people of the country are colorful and friendly and have a fascinating culture. There is a lot to do here. You can choose things such as trekking and adventure tours. Most of the activities give you the opportunity to take in <em>the beautiful green mountains, sparkling rivers and clear vistas.</em> The natural wealth of the area is, in many respects, unbeatable. Bangladesh is a paradise just waiting to be discovered!<br> </p>
