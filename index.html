												        <p id="all-pera"> The Roman colony of Corduba, founded in 152 BC, became capital of Baetica province, covering most of today’s Andalucía. <em>In 711 Córdoba fell to the Muslim invaders and soon became the Islamic capital on the Iberian Peninsula. It was here in 756 that Abd ar-Rahman I set himself up as emir of Al-Andalus</em>.<br>

													<strong>Córdoba’s heyday came under Abd ar-Rahman III (91261), who in 929 named himself caliph to set the seal on Al-Andalus’ independence of the Abbasid caliphs in Baghdad. Córdoba was then the biggest city in Western Europe and it had dazzling mosques</strong>, libraries, observatories and aqueducts, a university and highly skilled artisans in leather, metal, textiles and glazed tiles. <em>Abd ar-Rahman III’s</em> multicultural court was frequented by Jewish, Arab and Christian scholars, even if Córdoba was certainly not the fabulously tolerant paradise that’s sometimes imagined.<br>
